# StudentCapturingSystem

This JavaFX project was one of my assignments. The aim was to create a GUI application based on the idea of a student capturing system. A student can be added onto the system by entering their studentID, year of study, and 3 module allocations. A student's allocation of modules can be edited and a student can also be removed from the system.
